# icann-lookup-client
This is an example of lookup client that uses RDAP protocol for looking domain name information.

Every year, millions of individuals, businesses, organizations and governments register domain names. Each one must provide identifying and contact information which may include: name, address, email, phone number, and administrative and technical contacts. This information is often referred to as "RDAP data." But the RDAP service is not a single, centrally-operated database. Instead, the data is managed by independent entities known as "registrars" and "registries." Any entity that wants to become a registrar must earn ICANN accreditation. Similarly, registries are under contract with ICANN to operate a generic top level domain, such as .COM, .ORG, or one of the new gTLDs such as .STORAGE and .LINK.

Based on existing consensus policies and contracts, ICANN is committed to implement measures to maintain public access to RDAP information, subject to applicable laws. To do that, registrars and registries provide public access to data on registered domain names. Anyone can use the RDAP protocol to search their databases and identify the domain name registrant.
